    "#### The __new__ method in the code is a special method of python to instantiate objects which is used to control the objects creation. The object gets created with the __new__ method , but before creating the object, it checks whether the object already exists. The hasattr method is a special method in python to know if an object has a certain property. It is used to see if the clas object has the instance property, which checks whether the class already has an object.Here in our code we have requested s object before sA object. When s object is requested the hasattr() detects that object does not exists and hence s allocates the new object instance. When s1 object is requested, hasattr() detects that objet already exists and hence s1 allocates the existing object instance (located at 0x000002345C7A5B48)."
